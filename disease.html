          <h2>Blister Blight</h2>
          <p>
            Blister blight is a significant fungal disease that primarily
            affects tea plants, caused by the pathogen *Exobasidium vexans*.
            This disease manifests as small, pale yellow spots on the tea
            leaves, which eventually evolve into brown blisters, giving the
            affliction its name. These blisters can coalesce, leading to a large
            necrotic area that deforms the leaves and severely reduces the
            photosynthetic capacity of the plant. If left unchecked, blister
            blight can significantly diminish tea yields and quality, as the
            affected leaves are unsuitable for processing into tea. Effective
            management includes the application of fungicides, cultural
            practices to reduce leaf wetness, and the cultivation of resistant
            tea cultivars to mitigate the spread and impact of the disease.

          <h2>Algar Leaf Spot</h2>
          <p>
            Algar Leaf Spot is a lesser-known, possibly fictional or
            colloquially named plant disease, as the term does not correspond to
            any widely recognized plant pathology. However, if we were to infer
            from the name and general knowledge about leaf spot diseases, Algar
            Leaf Spot could be characterized as a condition where plants exhibit
            spotting on their foliage. These spots are typically a reaction to
            fungal or bacterial infections, manifesting as discolored lesions
            that can be yellow, brown, or black. Such spots often have a
            concentric ring pattern and can lead to premature leaf drop, reduced
            photosynthesis, and overall vigor of the plant. Management of leaf
            spot diseases generally includes practices like avoiding overhead
            watering to reduce leaf wetness, removing infected foliage,
            improving air circulation, and applying appropriate fungicides or
            bactericides. It's essential for gardeners and farmers to accurately
            diagnose the specific type of leaf spot to treat it effectively, as
            the causal agents and their remedies can significantly differ.

          <h2>Grey Blight</h2>
          <p>
            Grey blight, also known as Pestalotiopsis blight, is a fungal
            disease affecting various plant species, characterized by the
            appearance of small, greyish spots on the leaves. These spots may be
            surrounded by a reddish or yellowish halo and can coalesce into
            larger patches as the infection progresses. The centre of the spots
            often appears grey due to the presence of fungal spores. This
            disease is especially prevalent in humid and warm climates, where
            the conditions are favorable for the fungus to thrive. Grey blight
            can cause significant defoliation, weakening plants and potentially
            leading to reduced yields in crops. Management of grey blight
            includes practicing good sanitation, removing and destroying
            infected plant material, improving air circulation, and applying
            fungicides as necessary. For sustainable agriculture, it's also
            encouraged to use resistant varieties and to implement crop
            rotation.

          <h2>Brown Blight</h2>
          <p>
            Brown blight is a plant disease that presents as dark brown,
            necrotic spots on the leaves of affected plants. These spots can
            vary in size and often appear water-soaked at first before turning
            dry and brittle. This condition is typically caused by a pathogenic
            fungus or bacterium that thrives in wet, humid conditions. The
            lesions may start small but can expand, causing substantial damage
            to the photosynthetic tissue of the leaves. This can lead to stunted
            growth, reduced vigor, and, in severe cases, the death of the plant
            if the infection spreads unchecked. Management strategies for brown
            blight involve reducing leaf moisture through proper irrigation
            techniques, ensuring good air circulation around the plants, prompt
            removal of infected plant parts, and the use of fungicides or
            bactericides when necessary. Cultivating disease-resistant plant
            varieties and practicing crop rotation are also effective
            preventative measures.

          <h2>Helophelis</h2>
          <p>
            Helopeltis, commonly referred to as the tea mosquito bug, is an
            insect known for its detrimental impact on tea plants, although the
            name "Helophelis" seems to be a typographical error. These pests are
            notorious for attacking the tender parts of the plant, such as the
            buds, young leaves, and stems. The damage is caused by their
            piercing and sucking mouthparts, which extract the sap and
            nutrients, leading to the formation of characteristic brownish-black
            spots and streaks on the leaves. The affected areas often curl up
            and dry out, resulting in a condition known as "banjhi" in tea
            cultivation, where the growth of the shoots is halted. This can
            significantly affect the quality and quantity of the tea harvest.
            Management of Helopeltis infestations typically includes monitoring
            for early detection, maintaining field hygiene, encouraging natural
            predators, and applying insecticides when necessary. Integrated pest
            management strategies are essential to control the spread of
            Helopeltis while minimizing environmental impact.
